0 Elephants have around 150000 muscle units in their trunk
1 There are three different species of elephant – the African Savannah elephant, the African Forest elephant and the Asian elephant
2 Elephants are known for their large ears, tusks made of ivory and their trunks – which are actually a fusion of their nose and upper lip
3 Elephants are the world’s largest land animal! Male African elephants can reach 3m tall and weigh between 4,000 -7,500kg
4 Asian elephants are slightly smaller, reaching 2.7m tall and weighing 3,000– 6,000kg
5 There’s an easy way to tell the African elephants apart from their Asian cousins – their ears!
6 African elephants have large ears shaped like the continent of Africa! 
7 Asian elephants ears are smaller and shaped like India. Cool, huh?
8 Elephant tusks are actually enlarged incisor teeth which first appear when elephants are around 2 years old
9 Tusks continue growing throughout their lives
10 An elephants skin is 2.5cm thick in most places
11 The folds and wrinkles in their skin can retain up to 10 times more water than flat skin does, which helps to cool them down
12 They keep their skin clean and protect themselves from sunburn by taking regular dust and mud baths
13 Elephants need up to 150kg of food per day – thats around 375 tins of baked beans although half of this may leave the body undigested
14 They eat so much that they can spend up to three-quarters of their day eating
15 Amazingly, elephant calves are able to stand within 20 minutes of being born and can walk within 1 hour. 
16 The elephants temporal lobe (the area of the brain associated with memory) is larger and denser than that of people - hence the saying elephants never forget
17 African elephants have more rounded foreheads, while Asian elephants have twin domes on their heads with an indent in the middle
18 The tip of an African elephant’s trunk has two fingers or ‘lips’; the Asian elephant’s trunk only has one
19 While the African elephant’s back is concave (with a small hollow in it), the Asian elephant’s is convex (slightly domed)
20 In general, African elephants are larger. Adult males weigh up to six tonnes, while male Asian elephants usually weigh no more than five tonnes
21 Elephants are the world’s largest land mammals – and, aside from the great apes (humans, gorillas, chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans) – the most intelligent
22 Elephants are the world’s largest land mammal
23 Elephants eat a wide range of plant material, including grass, leaves, woody parts of trees and shrubs, flowers and fruits when available
24 Baby elephants weigh around 100kg on average, heavier than most adult men, and some newborns have been as large as 120kg
25 Baby elephants are called calves
26 African elephants have a gestation period of 22 months, while Asian elephants have a gestation period of 18-22 months
27 Tusks are actually hugely elongated upper incisor teeth embedded deep in the elephant’s head (up to a third of a tusk is hidden from view)
28 Elephant tusks have a variety of uses: as a tool to dig for food or water and to strip bark from trees; as a weapon in battles with rivals; and as a courtship aid – the larger his tusks, the more attractive a male elephant may appear to a female
29 Just as humans are right- or left-handed, elephants are known to use one tusk more than the other. This favoured appendage is sometimes referred to as the ‘master tusk’ and often appears more worn
30 Male and female African elephants naturally have tusks, but only male Asian elephants grow them
31 African elephants have a lifespan of up to 70 years in the wild, but tend not to live quite so long in captivity
32 Asian elephants have a shorter lifespan of around 48 years
33 Elephants can recognise themselves in mirrors
34 Though trunk-sucking is more common in the early stages of life, elephants of all ages do it, even big old bulls, usually when they are feeling nervous or unsure
35 Elephants appear to understand what other elephants are feeling
